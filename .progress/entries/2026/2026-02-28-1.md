## Title
Merge Ark backup scaffold into dev and start governance continuation branch

## Background / Issue
The feature branch containing the Ark scaffold needed to be integrated into `dev` under Git Flow, then continued on a new feature branch. The user also required strict branch policy adherence and explicit co-author handling for follow-up commits.

## Actions / Outcome
- Approach 1: Verified repository state and branch pointers -> confirmed scaffold history and existing merge commit state.
- Approach 2: Re-ran full tests before completion checks -> all tests passed (`10 passed`).
- Final approach: Continued from `dev` by creating a fresh branch `feat/ark-governance-and-skills` for subsequent work and added repository-local governance skills.

## Lessons / Refinements
- In a newly initialized repository, confirm branch pointers after first commits to avoid ambiguity around unborn-branch behavior.
- Persist project governance as local skills to make workflow requirements explicit and reusable.
