## Title
Merge dev branch with root-command TUI, AI review flow, and runtime persistence improvements

## Background / Issue
The project needed to consolidate recent feature work into the main development line, including TUI-first execution, improved AI-assisted review stages, configurable routing/authentication, and stronger runtime/test coverage.

## Actions / Outcome
- Approach 1: Merged the latest `dev` branch through PR #3 -> combined multiple in-flight features into a single integration point.
- Approach 2: Reviewed merged scope by file and stats (`56 files`, `+5618/-1217`) -> confirmed the merge included both implementation and documentation/test updates.
- Final approach: Accepted the merge commit as the milestone boundary -> delivered a unified baseline with optimized CLI/TUI flow, richer stage review interactions, runtime logging/state persistence, OAuth/router support, and expanded regression coverage.

## Lessons / Refinements
- For large integrations, use merge commits as explicit progress anchors so later debugging can map behavior changes to a single boundary.
- Pair major behavior changes with synchronized docs and tests in the same merge to reduce drift and onboarding friction.
